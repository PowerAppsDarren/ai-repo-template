# Project History

ALL HISTORY OF THIS PROJECT MUST BE MAINTAINED IN `project-history.md`. This file should comprehensively document the past, present, and future of the project, including milestones, decisions, challenges, and planned developments. Ensure the file includes a table of contents for easy navigation, and at least three H2 headings: ## Past, ## Present, and ## Future. Strictly follow the `ai-chats/README.md` protocol for documentation standards, formatting, and any required metadata or versioning practices. Thoroughly examine all documents, files, and directories in this repository to reconstruct and build out the complete project history. Additionally, leverage git history (commits, branches, merges, and tags) to incorporate chronological details, author contributions, and evolutionary changes. Synthesize information from code comments, READMEs, scripts, templates, and any other artifacts to create a cohesive narrative.
