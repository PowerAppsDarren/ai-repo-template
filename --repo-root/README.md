# Read Me

The purpose of this repo is to... (keep reading!)

## 🚨 ATTENTION ALL AI CODING ASSISTANTS 🚨

**This protocol MUST be followed by ALL AI tools:** Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Qwen CLI, Kilo Code Extension, Codex Extension, and any other AI coding assistant.

Read in and follow the directions laid out by this file: `ai-chats/README.md` with every exchange with the dev user!

^ REMEMBER THIS AT ALL TIMES!!

## Current Requirements

First thing we need is a well defined PRD, but let's start with this information to base it on. AI, ask me questions and work with me to help you help me create this well defined PRD which will be put in a file `./docs/PRD.md`.

Here we go:

- I want a numbered menu based script utility out of this repo.
- When the script(s) (I'd like to primarily focus on linux bash scripts, but eventually, I'd like counterpart scripts for other OS's) are run, all the files and sub-folders are shown from the `root-of-git-repo`.
- There is a folder here called `root-of-git-repo`. All or some of the contents should be copied to every repo found within a particular path (entered by the dev user - default will be `~/src`)
- This allows me to make one edit in one repo (this one), and copy it all out to all of my other repos.

help me bang out the rest of the requirements!
