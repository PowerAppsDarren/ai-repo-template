# AI Log

All AI tools much adhere to this ai-logging protocol! This is required and mandatory and shall be done!

- On each exchange with the dev user and also on every change that is made by any/all AI tools, you must append what happened in the `./ai-chats/ai-log.md` with a date/time stamp. The changes should be concise and read like good commit statements. This is an APPEND ONLY file operation. No deletions or other edits must not occur! This will be a markdown human-readable file that will serve as the log for the whole project!!
